# Safety and execution model

## Trust boundary

Grok is an external agent that can be wrong or manipulated by repository content. Codex remains the final verifier and should validate consequential claims and changes independently.

## Read-only agents

Read-only agents run under Grok's operating-system `read-only` sandbox with automatic tool approval. Project writes are blocked, although Grok may still write its own state under `~/.grok` and temporary files.

## Writing agents

Writing agents run under Grok's `workspace` sandbox with automatic approval. The bridge refuses to start one unless the target is a linked Git worktree whose `.git` entry is a file. The sandbox limits ordinary project writes to that worktree, plus Grok state and temporary paths.

## Session lifecycle

Each external agent owns one `grok agent stdio` process and one ACP session. The process remains alive for focused follow-ups and is killed when the agent closes or the MCP bridge exits. The bridge retains bounded public response text, plan updates, tool titles, statuses, and errors; it discards private thought chunks and authentication material.

The Grok process receives a minimal environment-variable allowlist. `XAI_API_KEY` and variables explicitly opted in through `GROK_PASSTHROUGH_ENV` remain visible to the official CLI and may be visible to its tools.

## Isolated search runs

`grok_search` does not use the current project as Grok's working directory. The bridge creates a private run under `~/.cache/grok-subagent/search-runs`, gives Grok temporary `HOME` / `GROK_HOME` values containing only auth and a minimal config, and exposes only `x_search`, `web_search`, and `web_fetch`.

This reduces accidental repository packaging and local-file inspection during research. It does not make Grok offline. Queries and retrieved public content still pass through xAI. Search answers remain untrusted external data.
