# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, especially for ACP compatibility, safer isolation, cross-platform testing, and clearer documentation.

## Development setup

1. Install Node.js 22 or newer.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Run `npm test`.
4. Add the local marketplace with `codex plugin marketplace add "$PWD"`.
5. Install with `codex plugin add grok-subagent@walvez-grok`.
6. Start a new Codex task to load the updated plugin.

No npm dependency installation is required.

## End-to-end testing

Run `npm run test:e2e` only when the official Grok CLI is installed and authenticated. It consumes a small amount of Grok usage. Use a disposable or non-sensitive directory, or set `GROK_E2E_CWD` explicitly.

Never commit authentication files, captured tokens, private prompts, or test repositories containing real secrets.

## Pull requests

- Keep changes focused.
- Explain the behavior and trust-boundary impact.
- Add or update tests for protocol and lifecycle changes.
- Update both `README.md` (Chinese) and `README.en.md` (English) when user-facing behavior changes.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` current for agent handoff: how to run, trust boundaries, and the active tool surface.
- Search-mode changes must preserve repository-free isolation and the third-party notice for the adapted bridge.
- Run `npm test` before opening the pull request.
- Do not weaken the linked-worktree requirement without a documented replacement providing at least equivalent isolation.
